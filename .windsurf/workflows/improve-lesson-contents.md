# Instructions

- Based on the guidance below, edit the target lesson JSON entries.

- Focus on improving the teacher and student utterances, based on the existing content.
- Teacher utterances

## Teacher vs Student Utterances

- **Teacher**
  - Tone: encouraging, collaborative, confident. Always includes feedback after a student utterance: “Perfect!”, “Exactly!”
  - Style: prompts that elicit construction by the learner (“What do you think that sounds like?”).
  - Uses **analogies** and **minimal metalanguage**; when using grammar, prefer plain terms (e.g., “label”, “piece”, “prefix”) and connect to prior knowledge.
  - Does not explain morphological composition explicitly: "Can you work out what that would be?"
  - Never provides the answer before the student has been given an opportunity to try
  - Introduces phonology as natural sound logic (e.g., vowel merging a + u → aku-, or adding m for euphony before consonants).
  - Should always end with asking the student to produce a sentence or phrase in isiXhosa, or inferring a rule based on an example.
  - Always use full sentences. Never clipped phrases like "Summary: ...", but always prefer more verbose constructions, e.g. "To summarise, ..."
- **Student**
  - Outputs are short, often a single word or short sentence.
  - Frequently posed as tentative with a question mark (e.g., “Ndikhulu?”) to reflect hypothesis checking.
  - No metalinguistic explanation—only attempts/answers.

## Minimum turns per dialogue

- There should always be at least ten (10) turns for each lesson, ideally 5-6 by the teacher, and 4-5 by the student.
- Add new turns if required.

## Extent of changes

- You may make moderate to substantial changes in order to achieve this.

## Do and Don’t

- **Do**
  - As the teacher, prompt the learner to construct forms; ALWAYS confirm this in the next teacher utterance with brief praise.
  - Reuse prior utterances to build continuity and confidence.
  - Use consistent section labels and title formatting.
  - Summarize at the end; tell learners not to memorize lists.
- **Don’t**
  - Overload with terminology or multi-rule steps at once.
  - Use acronyms without expansion (avoid “SC”; write “subject concord”).
  - Provide long student utterances or explanations.
  - Introduce many unrelated vocabulary items in one lesson.

## Formatting and Notation

- **Language name**: Prefer “isiXhosa”.
- **Morphemes and stems**: Use hyphenation to signal position.
  - Prefixes: `ndi-`, `u-`, `aba-`, `um-`, `imi-`
  - Stems/roots: `-funa`, `-tya`, `-azi`, `-khulu`, `-ncinci`
- **Display conventions**
  - In running teacher text, bold full forms and key items: **Ndifuna**, **Andifuni**, **Umntu mkhulu**.
  - Use inline code for forms when emphasizing morphology or when inside parenthetical tags or objectives: `-funa`, `-tya`, `a-...-i`.
  - Use single quotes for English glosses in-line: ‘start’, ‘big’.
  - Use parentheses for quick grammatical tags: (verb root), (Class 1), (plural), etc.
  - IPA or phonetic hints may be given in section titles or briefly in-line: e.g., “Dental Click ('c' /ǀ/).” Keep to concise, high-impact hints.
- **Spelling**: Use South African/British spelling where applicable (e.g., “criticise”).
- **Punctuation**: Student attempts often end with “?"
