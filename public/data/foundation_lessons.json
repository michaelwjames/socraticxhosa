          "justification": "This opening immediately **reframes the clicks from an 'impossible foreign sound' to a manageable combination of existing abilities**. By acknowledging potential difficulty but presenting a clear path, it **lowers learner anxiety** and sets the expectation of introducing concepts 'one thought at a time'.

          "justification": "This step **imports knowledge** from a known, non-linguistic sound and action, making the abstract sound concrete and less intimidating. Presenting it as slightly 'taboo or funny' can make it more memorable.
