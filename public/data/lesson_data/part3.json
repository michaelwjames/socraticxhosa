The agreement pieces for these classes, for our verb machine's 'who' slot (Lesson 11), are **i-** for singular Class 9, and **zi-** for plural Class 10. Just notice how the verb 'listens' to the noun's label. So, how would you say 'The dog is working' and 'The dogs are working'?",

For the **negative future**, 'I will work' (**Ndiza kusebenza** from Lesson 15) becomes **Andizu-kusebenza**.

In isiXhosa, we use 'absolute pronouns' for this. They are separate words that provide emphasis, but the verb *still* keeps its subject concord for agreement! For 'I', the emphatic form is **mna**. For 'you', it's **wena**. And for 'he/she' (referring to a person like **umntu** from Lesson 3), it's **yena**.

In English, we sometimes shift a verb's form in a subtle way, for instance saying 'I suggest that he *be* on time' instead of 'he *is* on time'. This shift creates a mood of suggestion, as if we are saying 'so that he may be on time'. IsiXhosa has a specific 'mood' for these kinds of suggestions and requests, and it's used very often. What do you think is the purpose of such a mood in language?",

IsiXhosa, however, often transforms the noun itself to carry this locational information, making it more integral to the word. Think of it like putting a special 'location wrapper' around the noun. What benefit might this 'location wrapper' approach have?",
          "justification": "This reframes locatives away from English prepositions to a 'noun transformation rule' or 'location wrapper,' which is more aligned with isiXhosa's agglutinative nature and helps manage cognitive load [2, 21, 27, 28]. The question prompts the learner to consider the *advantages* of this system, increasing language consciousness [Instruct 1, 9, 10]."

These aren't just separate words; they become part of the verb itself. Today, we'll learn '-isa' to mean 'to cause to do' (or often 'to use'), and '-ela' to mean 'to do for/on behalf of'.
