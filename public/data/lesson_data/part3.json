Today, we're going to tackle a very common and large category: Noun Class 9 for singulars, which often start with  **iN-**  (like  **inja** , 'dog'), and its plural, Class 10, which starts with  **iiN-**  (like  **izinja** , 'dogs'). These noun labels tell our verb machine's 'who' slot (Lesson 11) which agreement piece to use. For singular Class 9 nouns, the subject concord often just uses the initial vowel. What do you think the subject concord for  **inja**  would be?",

For the  **negative future** , 'I will work' ( **Ndiza kusebenza**  from Lesson 15) becomes  **Andizu-kusebenza** .

In English, we sometimes shift a verb's form in a subtle way, for instance saying 'I suggest that he  *be*  on time' instead of 'he  *is*  on time'. This shift creates a mood of suggestion, as if we are saying 'so that he may be on time'. IsiXhosa has a specific 'mood' for these kinds of suggestions and requests, and it's used very often.
