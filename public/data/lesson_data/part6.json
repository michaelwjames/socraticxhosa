These aren't exactly verbs or nouns; they are 'sound ideas' or ideophones. Think of them not as words you define, but as sounds you feel. We use them with the verb '-thi', which acts here like a way to present the sound. For example, 'gqi' is the sound of appearing suddenly. If 'gqi' is the sound of appearing suddenly, and the auxiliary verb '-thi' helps us use it, how do you think we would say 'He appeared suddenly'?",
