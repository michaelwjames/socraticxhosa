          "teacher_dialogue": "Welcome back! In Part 1, we learned how to build simple sentences like **Ndifuna iti** ('I want tea') [Lesson 4]. We focused on the 'who' piece, **ndi-** for 'I', and the 'what' piece, the verb root like **-funa**. Now, as we've discussed, the Thinking Method approaches language as a modular system, like a 'verb machine with slots' [Lesson 11 plan, Lesson 1]. Today, we're going to dive deeper into that machine to see how the verb itself is the engine of the sentence. Let's take a new root, **-sebenza**, which means 'to work'. We need to put pieces into our verb machine to say 'who' is working and 'when' they are working. Do you remember the **-ya-** piece we learned in Lesson 8, which can indicate emphasis or simply that the verb ends a sentence? In our present tense verb machine, **-ya-** acts as our 'when' piece. So, if we want to say 'I am working', how would you combine the 'who' piece (**ndi-** from Lesson 2), the 'when' piece (**-ya-** from Lesson 8), and our new 'what' piece (**-sebenza**)?",

But in isiXhosa, the 'to work' or 'to study' form, which we call the infinitive, has a special prefix: **uku-**. This **uku-** isn't just a simple 'to'; it's actually the prefix for a specific 'noun class' [Lessons 3, 6, 9] in isiXhosa, Class 15, which is for *actions* or *abstract concepts*. So, **ukusebenza** literally means both 'to work' and 'the act of working'. It's a dual-purpose word! How would you transform the root **-tya** ('eat' from Lesson 4) into its infinitive form?",
