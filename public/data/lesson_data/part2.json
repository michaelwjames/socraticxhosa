          "teacher_dialogue": "Welcome back! In Part 1, we learned how to build simple sentences like 'Ndifuna iti' ('I want tea'). We focused on the 'who' piece, 'ndi-' for 'I', and the 'what' piece, the verb root like '-funa'. As we've discussed, the Thinking Method approaches language as a modular system, like a 'verb machine with slots'. Today, we're going to dive deeper into that machine to see how the verb itself is the engine of the sentence. Let's take a new root, '-sebenza', which means 'to work'. We need to put pieces into our verb machine to say 'who' is working and 'when' they are working. Do you remember the '-ya-' piece we learned in Lesson 8, which can indicate emphasis or simply that the verb ends a sentence? In our present tense verb machine, '-ya-' acts as our 'when' piece. So, if we want to say 'I am working', how would you combine the 'who' piece ('ndi-' from Lesson 2), the 'when' piece ('-ya-' from Lesson 8), and our new 'what' piece ('-sebenza')?",
          "justification": "This opening explicitly weaves in content from previous lessons (Lesson 4 for Ndifuna iti, Lesson 8 for -ya-) and re-establishes the 'verb machine with slots' analogy.
